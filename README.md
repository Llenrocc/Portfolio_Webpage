# Portfolio Webpage

This page was made for me to be able to showcase my abilities, as well as display recent projects that I have worked on.
There were a lot of changes made throughout this process. The page I was working on, was ambitious considering what I was trying
to accomplish early on in the course. This was also a page I was working on, at the time I did not know if I would get all functionality for the former,
but I am submitting this because I would like to incorporate both when I can.

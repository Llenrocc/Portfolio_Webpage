            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I am a full-stack web developer in Toronto, Canada. I attended a coding bootcamp at the University of Toronto in 2020, which really helped pointing
              me in the right direction of my goal, becoming a web developer. I found React to be among the most challenging, but also the most rewarding. 
              I gained more of an interest in the front end frameworks, and want to continue to learn UI/UX design. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a background in Film & Tv Production. I have attended Niagara College in 2008, and Trebas Institute, Toronto, 
              in 2010. During these times, I was able to get my hands dirty and really start hammering out a foundation with my current 
              skill set. I spent a lot of time editing tv/film, music, as well as participating in sound scores, ADR, foley, and soundfx.
              I am a budding amateur photographer who enjoys Photoshop, Lightroom, and music production in my spare time.

              <p>
                This isn't just my project, it's our project. Looks aren't just everything. Our goal is to create an application that impresses
                you, as well as the public. From every color, nav bar, effects, pictures etc. I ensure that I will never be 100% finished
                until I have exceeded the clients expectations.

              This is a simple application that allows the user to search for a recipe with any ingredients found in your fridge.
              If you are not sure what to make, this is the app for you. With ease of use, the program allows you to enter in different
              ingredients that will help you narrow down your search. Once you have listed your ingredients, an API call will return a list
              of various recipes that can be made with those ingredients. We list all necessary ingredients, servings, etc. You can also 
              click the link and it will take you to a page with the whole meal.

              It can be very difficult to keep track of your busy days sometimes. That's why this day planner is perfect. Very user friendly,
